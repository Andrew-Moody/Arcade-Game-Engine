# Simple-2D-Game-Engine
### A basic 2D game engine written in C++ with SDL2

As part of Harvard's CS50x online course, we are asked to create a final project that can be anything we want.
The project I have chosen to create is a simple 2D game engine. The engine is written in C++ and uses SDL2 to handle texture rendering. 


The project is broken into engine and game components where the engine is able to stand alone separate from any game specific files.
Along with the engine a sample game will be created to show off features of the engine. The initial commit includes enough game code to provide a movable character with animation.
